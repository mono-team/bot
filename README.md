## About

Mono is an open source multipurpose Discord bot coded with warmth and love in Typescript using [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

## Discord.js Fork

I use fork of Discord.js to return extendable structures, which [were removed in v13](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/pull/6027). The structure problems mentioned in the issue do not apply to Mono. On the contrary, structs help keep code clean and comfortable.
